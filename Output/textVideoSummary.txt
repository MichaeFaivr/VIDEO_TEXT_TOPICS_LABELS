I have it's quite reliable fast easy to use 
I mostly use the temperature for a teaching in python programming in vs code IDE 
they keep match is also perfectly stable four digits can't digital contents do you need to catch 
negative points I experienced is the back key which is malfunctional malfunctioning maybe due to a flow in the design animal king of the keyboard 
as summary of my 8-month experience with ASUS VivoBook 17 and the plus side it's convenient for coding and digital content the screen is comfortable for the site 
on the negative side the back touch is not right label for AI codes involving heavy models and or inputs the processor is not able to handle the duty I have to switch to a Google Cloud facility 
as conclusion the price quality trailer is quite good for this laptop 
I recommend it to anyone looking for a laptop in this price range byI have it's quite reliable fast easy to use I mostly use the temperature for a teaching in python programming in vs code IDE they keep match is also perfectly stable four digits can't digital contents do you need to catch negative points I experienced is the back key which is malfunctional malfunctioning maybe due to a flow in the design animal king of the keyboard as summary of my 8-month experience with ASUS VivoBook 17 and the plus side it's convenient for coding and digital content the screen is comfortable for the site on the negative side the back touch is not right label for AI codes involving heavy models and or inputs the processor is not able to handle the duty I have to switch to a Google Cloud facility as conclusion the price quality trailer is quite good for this laptop I recommend it to anyone looking for a laptop in this price range byI have it's quite reliable fast easy to use I mostly use the temperature for a teaching in python programming in vs code IDE they keep match is also perfectly stable four digits can't digital contents do you need to catch negative points I experienced is the back key which is malfunctional malfunctioning maybe due to a flow in the design animal king of the keyboard as summary of my 8-month experience with ASUS VivoBook 17 and the plus side it's convenient for coding and digital content the screen is comfortable for the site on the negative side the back touch is not right label for AI codes involving heavy models and or inputs the processor is not able to handle the duty I have to switch to a Google Cloud facility as conclusion the price quality trailer is quite good for this laptop I recommend it to anyone looking for a laptop in this price range byI have it's quite reliable fast easy to use I mostly use the temperature for a teaching in python programming in vs code IDE they keep match is also perfectly stable four digits can't digital contents do you need to catch negative points I experienced is the back key which is malfunctional malfunctioning maybe due to a flow in the design animal king of the keyboard as summary of my 8-month experience with ASUS VivoBook 17 and the plus side it's convenient for coding and digital content the screen is comfortable for the site on the negative side the back touch is not right label for AI codes involving heavy models and or inputs the processor is not able to handle the duty I have to switch to a Google Cloud facility as conclusion the price quality trailer is quite good for this laptop I recommend it to anyone looking for a laptop in this price range byI have it's quite reliable fast easy to use I mostly use the temperature for a teaching in python programming in vs code IDE they keep match is also perfectly stable four digits can't digital contents do you need to catch negative points I experienced is the back key which is malfunctional malfunctioning maybe due to a flow in the design animal king of the keyboard as summary of my 8-month experience with ASUS VivoBook 17 and the plus side it's convenient for coding and digital content the screen is comfortable for the site on the negative side the back touch is not right label for AI codes involving heavy models and or inputs the processor is not able to handle the duty I have to switch to a Google Cloud facility as conclusion the price quality trailer is quite good for this laptop I recommend it to anyone looking for a laptop in this price range by
