If Mark Cuban was 16 years old again and “needed to make some extra money,” he’d start one specific side hustle in just three steps, 
he tells CNBC Make It.
 The average pay for AI tutors starts at about $30,000 per year, 
 and full-time AI prompt engineers can make up to $129,500, according to job board platform ZipRecruiter.
 “Doesn’t matter if I’m 16, I’d be teaching them as well.”
More than half of Gen Zers in the U.S. currently have side hustles, a LendingTree report found in February. 
You don’t need a college degree to become an AI prompt engineer, but you do need practice — and, often, certifications — 
to learn how those large language models operate. 
Cuban’s hypothetical side hustle is more high-tech than his actual first job, 
selling garage bags door-to-door to his neighbors outside of Pittsburgh at age 12 to save up for a new pair of basketball shoes. 
“Then, I would go to businesses, particularly small- to medium-sized businesses that don’t understand AI yet,” says Cuban.
